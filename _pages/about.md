Hello, my name is Siddharth (Sid) Arya. I am a machine learning researcher/engineer. Currently, I am in my final year of a BS in Computer Science at the University of Toronto. Alognside courses on fundemntal principles of computer science, with a focus of machine learning, I have also had the pleasure of taking part in research as an undergrad. I have worked under the supervision of  [Prof. Rahul Krishnan](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/index.html) at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) on explaining model inference in the healthcare sector, as well as developing novel methods to monitor models post-deployment. I am currently working with [Prof. Marsha Chechik](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~chechik/) on creating requirment specifications for software systems with image classification models - to avoid model failure. Additionally, I am currently a member in the [Dynamic Graphics Project Lab](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof Kyros Kutulakos](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kyros/) working on processing algorithms for SPAD (single-photon-avalanche diode) cameras.

I am currently looking in 2 directions: (i) Joining Industry as a Machine Learning Engineer in order to learn about the issues involved with putting machine learning models into production. (ii) Persuing Graduate Studies in Computer Science to cultivate my interest in researching models. Feel free to reach out to me at ('sid19arya' @ 'gmail.com').

Oh, and I also play the football (not the American version) and am learning the guitar. 

Research and Work Interests
======
I consider myself a novice in the machine learning field, my primary interest would be working with Excellent and Accomplished Researchers to learn from them! 

Work I am interest in:

- **Explainable AI** 
- **Causal Inference** : I believe that the path to generalizable and truly 'intelligent' models is through a causal understanding of the world
- **Robotics**
- **Uncertainty Quantification**

Beyond that some of the work I done so far:

- **Explainable AI** : understanding the way models behave that they do
- **Guardrails for AI** : how can we add automated supervision for knowing when AI models might start making mistakes
- **Computational Imaging** (new addition): how do camera's capture images, how can we develop these image capturing capabilities in different contexts
