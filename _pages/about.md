Hello, my name is Siddharth (Sid) Arya. I am a machine learning researcher/engineer. Currently, I am in my final year of a BS in Computer Science at the University of Toronto. Alongside courses on fundemntal principles of computer science, with a focus of machine learning, I have also had the pleasure of taking part in research as an undergrad. I have worked under the supervision of  [Prof. Rahul Krishnan](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/index.html) at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) on explaining model inference in the healthcare sector, as well as developing novel methods to monitor models post-deployment. I also worked with [Prof. Marsha Chechik](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~chechik/) on creating requirment specifications for software systems with image classification models - to avoid model failure. Additionally, I am currently a member in the [Dynamic Graphics Project Lab](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof Kyros Kutulakos](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kyros/) working on processing algorithms for SPAD (single-photon-avalanche diode) cameras.

While I deeply enjoy research, I am eager to transition into a more applied setting where I can leverage my background in machine learning to solve real-world business challenges. I want to see firsthand how ML models impact decision-making, optimize processes, and drive innovation beyond academic settings. 

Some highlights:
- Published a python package alongside peers at Vector to allow users to validate their models in a production scenario (unlabeled test data): [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/bayesian-dpddm/), [Github_Repo](https://github.com/teivng/bayesian_dpddm)
- Received a research grant from the Data Science Institute at UofT to conduct a benchmark study of contemporary data shift detection methods and presented research findings at the annual SUDS showcase: [Linkdin_Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sid19arya_datascience-research-healthcare-activity-7241829797939568640-zhIK?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAD2auggBIQAk0-jVRiaXH7EfYt2nRjTrock)

Research and Work Interests
======
I consider myself a novice in the machine learning field, my primary interest would be working with Excellent and Accomplished Researchers to learn from them! 

Work I am interest in:

- **Explainable AI** 
- **Causal Inference** : I believe that the path to generalizable and truly 'intelligent' models is through a causal understanding of the world
- **Robotics**
- **Uncertainty Quantification**

Beyond that some of the work I done so far:

- **Explainable AI** : understanding the way models behave that they do
- **Guardrails for AI** : how can we add automated supervision for knowing when AI models might start making mistakes
- **Computational Imaging** (new addition): how do camera's capture images, how can we develop these image capturing capabilities in different contexts

Oh, and I also play the football (not the American version) and am learning the guitar.
