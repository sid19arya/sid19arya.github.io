In this work, we consider image classifications models in larger software systems - and thus construct functional requirments for said system based on categories of inputs on which our image classifcation performs well vs poorly. This is done through an auxiliary image captioning system which allows interpretable representation on inputs that depict inputs over which our image classificaiton system may fail.
