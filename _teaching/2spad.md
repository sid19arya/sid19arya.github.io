In this project, we use SPAD (single photon avalanche diode) cameras for a superior way of creating images under low-light and high-speed movement scenarios. We first ran characterizing experiments to understand the behaviour of the SPAD camer under different light levels and exposure times. Following this, we iterate and build on existing methods which probe for Fourier Signal over time based on non-uniform photon incidence time stamps.
