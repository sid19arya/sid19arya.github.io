In this project, we use SPAD (single photon avalanche diode) cameras for a superior way of imging under low-light and high movement scenarios. We first ran characterizing experiments to understand the behaviour of the SPAD camera. Following this, we iterate and build on existing methods which probe for Forier Transformations over time based on non-uniform photon incidence time stamps.
