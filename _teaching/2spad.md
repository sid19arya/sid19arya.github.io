This project explores the potential of **Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) cameras** as a groundbreaking imaging modality for low-light and high-speed scenarios. SPAD cameras, capable of detecting and timestamping individual photons, open new avenues in imaging dynamic scenes. We conducted **characterization experiments** to understand SPAD behavior under varying light levels and exposure times, revealing significant challenges with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in low-lux conditions. Addressing this, we reviewed state-of-the-art algorithms leveraging photon timestamps, identifying the lack of effective denoising as a critical gap. By assuming local homogeneity across pixel grids, we developed a method to reduce noise, enabling **improved flux reconstruction over time** and clearer dynamic frame captures.  

To maximize imaging capabilities, we are now investigating **hybrid sensor systems**, combining SPAD cameras with conventional sensors. This interplay leverages SPADâ€™s strengths in low-light and dynamic scenarios while utilizing the high bandwidth and cost efficiency of conventional sensors for high-flux environments, creating a versatile solution for diverse imaging challenges.
